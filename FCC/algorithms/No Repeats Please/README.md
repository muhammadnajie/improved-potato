## Instruction

Return the number of total permutations of the provided string that don't have repeated consecutive letters. Assume that all characters in the provided string are each unique.

For example, _aab_ should return 2 because it has 6 total permutations (_aab_, _aab_, _aba_, _aba_, _baa_, _baa_), but only 2 of them (_aba_ and _aba_) don't have the same letter (in this case a) repeating.
